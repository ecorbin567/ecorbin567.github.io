		I'm a computer science specialist at the University of Toronto with minors in mathematics and
		urban studies. My academic interests are in using data science and mathematical
		modelling to understand and solve pressing societal and urban issues. I'm also pursuing a focus in the
		theory of computation and hope to expand my research further into theoretical computer science
		and mathematics someday.

		Some other background stuff: I'm originally from Niskayuna, New York, USA, but have lived in Toronto
		since fall 2023. I received UofT's International Scholar Award and was a Dean's List Scholar in 2024 and 2025.

		Fun facts:
		<br>
		I was recently <a href="https://www.cp24.com/video/2025/06/10/goats-working-away-to-graze-invasive-plant-species-at-the-evergreen-brickworks/" target="_blank">interviewed on CP24</a> as a random spectator at a goat grazing event.
		<br>
		I'm involved in UofT's campus theatre scene as a lighting and sound designer and sometimes actor.
		<br>
		I was a chant leader at the 2023 Toronto March to End Fossil Fuels. I'm also a volunteer with Cycle Toronto and 
		helped canvas against the anti-bike lane Bill 212.
		<br>
		I'm a former cyclocross and mountain bike racer who now feels inadequate every time I get passed on 
		Bloor by a guy in Lycra.
		<br>
		I own the domain name electiontampering.com (visit the crosswords page to find out why)
		<br>
		I have been to every TTC subway station.
		<br>
		My mom met Sam Bankman-Fried when he was a toddler. This has nothing to do with me but I think it's fun.
		<br>
		I went to the same high school as one of the creators of the RSA algorithm, the founder of Airbnb, and a k-pop star.
		(Those are three different people.)
