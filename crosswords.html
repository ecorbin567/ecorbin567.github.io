		I publish crossword puzzles in various newspapers and indie crossword outlets, as well as on my blog,
		<a href="https://www.cruciverbology.com/" target="_blank">Cruciverbology</a>. My blog focuses on puzzles with themes related to math,
		science, and technology, as well as interesting shapes and grid gimmicks.
		<br><br>
		I've been published in: 
		<br>
		the New York Times (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2023-02-02.html" target="_blank">here</a> is the puzzle and Wordplay column writeup)
		<br>
		UofT's newspaper, The Varsity
		<br>
		indie outlets such as AVCX, Puzzmo, Fireball, Inkubator, Crucinova, and Lemonade Disco
		<br>
		the Spyscape Museum 
		<br>
		Burning Man's Wordplay Cafe 
		<br>
		the Redstone crossword puzzle app
		<br><br>
		In 2025, I published my first two cryptic crosswords at AVCX Cryptic and Cryptic Crossweird! I also joined the staff constructor roster at The Globe and Mail.
		<br><br>
		I constructed a puzzle for the 2024 Boswords Winter Wondersolve and the 2024 edition of <a href="https://www.abortionpuzzles.com/tpfa-4" target="_blank">These Puzzles Fund Abortion</a>,
		as well as creating my own charity puzzle pack, <a href="https://www.cruciverbology.com/post/words-on-fire-announcement-and-preview-puzzle" target="_blank">Words on Fire</a>, in 2023.
		<br><br>
		Obviously I recommend checking out my blog for more information, but here are some of my favourite puzzles
		that I've made.

	<div class="text-block">
		<b><a href="https://www.cruciverbology.com/post/you-re-projecting" target="_blank">You're Projecting</a></b> is my most 
		popular blog puzzle (so far), and it won the 2025 ORCA award for Best Themed Crossword!
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="text-block">
		<b><a href="https://www.electiontampering.com/" target="_blank">Election Tampering</a></b> was
		my first ever published puzzle, in 2020! It was constructed for the 2020 US election... simpler times.

	<br>
	<div class="text-block">
		<b><a href="https://www.cruciverbology.com/post/to-infinity-and-beyond" target="_blank">To Infinity And Beyond</a></b> is
		another blog favourite, and I'm really proud that I got this to work.

	<br>
	<div class="text-block">

	<br>
	<div class="text-block">
		<b><a href="https://www.cruciverbology.com/post/polar-plunge" target="_blank">Polar Plunge</a></b> is
		a Pi Day puzzle, if you're one of those people.
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="text-block">
		<b><a href="https://www.cruciverbology.com/post/big-telescope-small-puzzle" target="_blank">Big Telescope, Small Puzzle</a></b> is
		a fun little mini with a twist, and my recommendation for new crossword solvers.
